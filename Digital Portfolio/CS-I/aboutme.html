  Recent DRAMA:<br>
  This section features all the latest drama in the school(that obviously I have a connection with)<br>
  1. Recent rumors surround Aditya Sudharshan as Srujan Sannihdi claims he has "stolen his code." There is no proof of this yet, however, there might be some discord clips on it<br>
  2. Former Algerba Student of the Month: Zaid Rabadi talks about passing his honor to the next to student. He says "Yea it was fun while it lasted, I knew coming into this I couldnt keep it forever. I just hope the next person enjoys it and respects the award.<br>
  3. Many people say French Music sucks but this is not always the case. French music is great, because of artists, lyrics, and cultural diffusion. The words and rythm you feel when listening to french music is unmatched. Im legit listening to it right now. I know that made no sense but what do you think?"<div class="strawpoll-embed" id="strawpoll_NoZrL6MKGn3" style="height: 480px; max-width: 640px; width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; display: flex; flex-direction: column;"><iframe title="StrawPoll Embed" id="strawpoll_iframe_NoZrL6MKGn3" src="https://strawpoll.com/embed/polls/NoZrL6MKGn3" style="position: static; visibility: visible; display: block; width: 100%; flex-grow: 1;" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowtransparency>Loading...</iframe><script async src="https://cdn.strawpoll.com/dist/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br>

  <h1>Why is this important</h1>
  This portfolio is very important to the Computer Science Class I'm taking. This portfolio makes everything I do whether its, Journals to Aboutmes easy and accessible throughout the year. Anyone can visit my website, and I try my best to make it look good and presentable to my viewers (As if im famous). I also like the fact that its customizable to me. I cant put whatever I want whenever I want. Also Mrs Jang if your reading this, I hope you like the aboutme. <br>
  Cheers!<br>
