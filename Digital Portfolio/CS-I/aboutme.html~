  <h1>Why is this important</h1>
  This portfolio is very important to the Computer Science Class I'm taking. This portfolio makes everything I do whether its, Journals to Aboutmes easy and accessible throughout the year. Anyone can visit my website, and I try my best to make it look good and presentable to my viewers (As if im famous). I also like the fact that its customizable to me. I cant put whatever I want whenever I want. Also Mrs Jang if your reading this, I hope you like the aboutme. <br>
  Cheers!<br>
